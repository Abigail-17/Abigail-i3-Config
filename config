# THIS is your MOD key, defined as a variable to be used in almost every keyboard shortcut controlling windows.
# By default, it is set as "Mod4" which is the "Super" key (AKA "Windows" key)

# HERE is where you may set your default terminal. 
# This will open when you use your terminal summon keybind.
# If you do not wish to use alacritty, replace it with whatever you prefer.

# HERE is where you can set your workspace configuration.

# First, set monitor configuration.
# These variables will be used later in determining which monitor you want your workspaces to display on.
# The simplest way to find the names of your displays is to use the  "xrandr" command. 
# This will output a list of your display outputs, allowing you to find which display is which and define them based on this.


set $monitor1 DP-4
set $monitor2 HDMI-0
#set $monitor3 


# Choose which monitor you want each workspace to display on

workspace 3 output $monitor1
workspace 4 output $monitor1
workspace 5 output $monitor1
workspace 6 output $monitor1
